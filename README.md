## Introduction

This project showcases the implementation of ETL workflows using Shell scripting, Apache Airflow, and Kafka. It covers various stages of the ETL process, including data extraction, transformation, and loading into a data store.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

- `staging/`: Directory for staging data before processing.
- `dags/`: Apache Airflow DAGs and associated scripts.
- `shell_commands/`: Shell scripts for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- Other relevant project files.
